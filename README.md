## About the Project

Scana is mobile application that offers code scanning for both iOS and Android devices. The application offers a modern sleek user interface design with a fresh green color palette with subtle hints of grey, black and white colors.

Scana was initially created as a case collaboration between a known IT company in Borl√§nge, SE and a group of students (including me) for a course I enrolled in called "Systems Development on the Internet/Intranet". The project was created during my final year and the assignment was to create an early prototype of a scanning application.

Furthermore, the shown application here is a stripped version of the original and only highlights certain parts of the mobile application.
